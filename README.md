# ESP32 GroceryPad
## Author: Ryan Beck
## Description:

The ESP32 GroceryPad integrates an E-Paper display with a local HTTP server to periodically update the display with items from a grocery list. The grocery list is stored as a reminder on an iOS device, and using HTTP POST, the list is sent to the ESP32.
